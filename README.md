# SpaceEngineersZeppelinController
Zeppelin Controller mod for TheLastBastion

This mod adds new functionality to certain cockpits;
It implements a Feedforward and a Feedback (PID) controller for zeppelin gas cells in order to track altitude.

It also implements a feedback controller to keep the zeppelins upright, by applying corrective angular accelerations.
